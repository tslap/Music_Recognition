# Music_Recognition


This repo contains my final project for CS450 where I wrote a program that can recognize the pitch and tempo of a monophonic piece of music. 
I was also able to accurately identify the tempo of a few pop songs although the pitch recognition broke down for these more complicated examples.

Final.m contains all of the code I used to transcribe the music clips and produce the plots contained in my final write up. 

CS450_Final contains is the write up where I walk through my code and the underlying mathematics. This is also where I present examples of the transcriptions. 

Guitar_Gscale.aifc is the clip of music transcribed in the final section of my writeup.
